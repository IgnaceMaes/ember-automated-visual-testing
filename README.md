# Automated Visual Testing in Ember

This repository contains the code as presented in the talk on EmberFest 2022 titled [Automated Visual Testing in Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m90m9lVEFlY). It contains a dummy Ember application which visualizes holidays of multiple users on a calendar. It serves as an example on how visual testing can be set up and made to run reliably.

> Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever made a change that broke your application layout while still passing all tests?
> In this talk weâ€™ll explore the world of visual testing to keep your app pixel perfect and have that peace of mind when deploying. By the end, you should be able to understand how visual testing works and how to set it up in a reliable way, even for applications with complex data structures and time dependent logic.
